[00:11.96] Where's my snare?
[00:15.62] I have no snare on my headphones
[00:31.62] 
[00:21.07] There you go
[00:24.02] Yeah
[00:28.16] Yo
[00:29.40] Yo
[00:32.97] Have you ever been hated or discriminated against?
[00:36.23] I have
[00:37.16] I've been protested and demonstrated against
[00:39.76] Picket signs for my wicked rhymes
[00:42.11] Look at the times
[00:43.19] Sick as the mind of the motherfucking kid that's behind
[00:45.83] All this commotion, emotions run deep as oceans explodin'
[00:49.32] Tempers flarin' from parents, just blow 'em off and keep goin'
[00:52.67] Not takin' nothin' from no one, give 'em hell long as I'm breathin'
[00:56.02] Keep kickin' ass in the mornin' and takin' names in the evenin'
[00:59.03] Leavin' with a taste as sour as vinegar in their mouth
[01:02.34] See they can trigger me
[01:03.83] But they never figure me out
[01:05.69] Look at me now
[01:06.79] I betcha probably sick of me now
[01:08.80] Ain't you, mama?
[01:09.86] Imma make you look so ridiculous now
[01:11.96] I'm sorry mama
[01:14.63] I never meant to hurt you
[01:17.84] I never meant to make you cry
[01:20.25] But tonight
[01:21.22] I'm cleanin' out my closet
[01:23.37] One more time
[01:25.08] I said I'm sorry mama
[01:27.40] I never meant to hurt you
[01:30.54] I never meant to make you cry
[01:33.00] But tonight
[01:34.17] I'm cleanin' out my closet
[01:36.36] Ah
[01:38.17] I got some skeletons in my closet and I don't know if no one knows it
[01:41.77] So before they throw me inside my coffin and close it
[01:44.63] Imma expose it
[01:46.00] I'll take you back to '73
[01:47.63] Before I ever had a multi-platinum sellin' CD
[01:50.80] I was a baby
[01:52.12] Maybe I was just a couple of months
[01:54.13] My faggot father must've had his panties up in a bunch
[01:57.34] 'Cause he split
[01:58.44] I wonder if he even kissed me goodbye
[02:00.51] No, I don't owe him a second thought
[02:02.76] I just fuckin' wished he would die
[02:04.08] I look at Hailie
[02:05.16] And I couldn't picture leavin' her side
[02:07.09] Even if I hated Kim
[02:08.68] I'd grit my teeth and I'd try
[02:10.35] To make it work with her, at least for Hailie's sake
[02:12.49] I maybe made some mistakes but I'm only human
[02:15.24] But I'm man enough to face 'em today
[02:17.42] What I did was stupid
[02:19.02] No doubt it was dumb
[02:20.19] But the smartest shit I did was take the bullets outta that gun
[02:23.17] 'Cause I'd have killed 'em
[02:24.94] Shit, I woulda shot Kim and them both
[02:26.66] It's my life
[02:27.55] I'd like to welcome ya'll to the Eminem Show
[02:29.84] I'm sorry mama
[02:32.40] I never meant to hurt you
[02:35.66] I never meant to make you cry
[02:37.91] But tonight
[02:38.98] I'm cleanin' out my closet
[02:41.13] One more time
[02:42.68] I said I'm sorry mama
[02:45.31] I never meant to hurt you
[02:48.54] I never meant to make you cry
[02:50.92] But tonight
[02:51.91] I'm cleanin' out my closet
[02:55.26] Now I would never diss my own mama just to get recognition
[02:58.86] Take a second to listen 'fore you think this record is dissin'
[03:02.25] But put yourself in my position
[03:04.01] Just try to envision
[03:05.57] Witnessin' your mama poppin' prescription pills in the kitchen
[03:08.62] Bitchin' that someone's always goin' through hear purse
[03:11.29] And shit's missin'
[03:12.33] Goin' through public housin' systems, victim of Munchhausen's Syndrome
[03:15.12] My whole life I was made to believe I was sick when I wasn't
[03:18.47] 'Til I grew up, now I blew up
[03:20.29] It makes you sick to your stomach, doesn't it?
[03:22.00] Wasn't it the reason you made that CD for me, ma?
[03:24.71] So you could try to justify the way you treated me, ma?
[03:28.12] But guess what?
[03:29.22] You're gettin' older now and it's cold when you're lonely
[03:31.60] And Nathan's growin' up so quick
[03:33.29] He's gonna know that you're phony
[03:34.86] And Hailie's getting' so big now
[03:36.56] You should see her, she's beautiful
[03:38.04] But you'll never see her
[03:39.41] She won't even be at your funeral
[03:41.27] See, what hurts me the most is you won't admit you was wrong
[03:44.51] Bitch, do your song
[03:45.62] Keep tellin' yourself that you was a mom
[03:47.64] But how dare you try to take what you didn't help me to get?
[03:50.34] You selfish bitch
[03:52.01] I hope you fuckin' burn in hell for this shit
[03:54.05] Remember when Ronnie died and you said you wished it was me?
[03:57.48] Well, guess what?
[03:59.03] I am dead, dead to you as can be!
[04:00.96] I'm sorry mama
[04:03.35] I never meant to hurt you
[04:06.09] I never meant to make you cry
[04:08.82] But tonight
[04:09.86] I'm cleanin' out my closet
[04:12.27] One more time
[04:13.35] I said I'm sorry mama
[04:16.26] I never meant to hurt you
[04:19.30] I never meant to make you cry
[04:21.97] But tonight
[04:22.83] I'm cleanin' out my closet
