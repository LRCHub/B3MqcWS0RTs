Pay attention dear friend
You're far too high
To be jumping off the building and to die
That exit draws you near
But the smiles in the room say
We've come to play run away
So be ready for your time
You're heart beats faster
As your gone in the blink of an eye
But you have no worry or fray
'Cus the end of the day
We feed on dismay you're the prey
We are puppets created by madness
Painting a canvas darker than life
(Follow, Greet, Wait, Repeat)x2
Look around can you see the dismay
We are creations developin salvation
Your own demise will cry
(Follow, Greet, Wait, Repeat)x2
Take a moment to decide
Do you run or hide
Your heart rate plummets tonight
Are you ready for the
Time of your life!
Walk down the corridor
You shine your light through the lasting night
You walk through this bloody floor
We follow, we greet, we wait and repeat
Now forward through this linear path
Peer past the doors that hold you wrath
How long can hope keep you on your seat
We follow, we greet, we wait and repeat
...
Now i know we scare you and awful lot
But you're broken torch
It pisses me off
So gamble your life with one last shot
But we know of the price you'll pay
You're afraid you'll decay
Look down through the fear inside
You ask these questions
Where am? I will I die? Can I hide?
But you overlook one little thought
You we're caught for a reason
You dispicable demonical scum
You are a criminal encaved by sadness
Your own life is doomed whit fright
(Follow, Greet, Wait, Repeat)x2
Can't you se you will how to your kness
For your forgiveness
Dependant on defamation
We chose your fate tonight
(Follow, Greet, Wait, Repeat)x2
Take a moment to decide
Do you run or hide
Your heart rate plummets tonight
Are you ready for the
Time of your life!
Walk down the corridor
You shine your light through the lasting night
You walk through this bloody floor
We follow, we greet, we wait and repeat
Now forward through this linear path
Peer past the door that hold you wrath
How long can hope keep you on your seat
We follow, we greet, we wait and repeat
I am the follower run with me
And you will see
What is coming to thee
I am the greeter I'm out the door
Don't be shy
Or i'll kill you more
I am the waiter look at me
Turn away from me
Bare bones you will be
We're three of a kind
Really hope your don't mind
Just understand
Your blood is MINE!
...
Soon
Your blood trails through the cracks
Your death is mine!
Walk down the corridor
You shine your light through the lasting night
You walk through this bloody floor
We follow, we greet, we wait and repeat
Now forward through this linear path
Peer past the doors that hold your wrath
How long can hope keep you on your seat
We follow, we greet, we wait and REPEAT!!
