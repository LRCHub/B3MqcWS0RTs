Oh Billie I want you so
I'm trying to meet you
Too many things they don't know
Too many repeatings of beatings

And I'm walking around your closet
I want you to say my name again
I'm walking around your closet
I want you to say my name again

So Billie I lost control
I'm trying to meet you
Too many things they don't know
Too many repeatings of beatings

So I'm walking around your closet
I want you to say my name again
I'm walking around your closet
I want you to say my name again

So don't stop
Don't stop
Don't turn around

So Billie I lost control
I'm trying to meet you
Too many things they don't know
Too many repeatings of beatings
Of beatings

And I'm walking around your closet
I want you to say my name again
I'm walking around your closet
I want you to say my name again

I'm walking around your closet
I want you to say my name again
I'm walking around your closet
I want you to say my name again

So Billie I lost control
I want you to say my name again
Oh Billie I lost control
I want you to say my name again
So Billie I lost control
I want you to say my name again
Oh Billie I lost control
I want you to say my name again

Don't stop
Don't stop
Don't turn around
